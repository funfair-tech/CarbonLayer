## Uniswap Hook
A proof of concept Uniswap v4 Hook, which integrates with Carbon Layer to adjust the pool fee based on the percentage of carbon-neutral energy being used to power the grid.

A use case of this hook could be to add it to a pool of RWA's that track energy providers, ensuring trades are only placed in a low carbon transactions.

#### Getting Started
Uniswap v4 relies on EIP-1153: Transient storage which will be included in the Cancun update. In the meantime this sample can only be run on the Uniswap sandbox.
